# Encrypted-Solana

Introduction
Welcome to the Encrypted Solana Project — a cutting-edge implementation of private transaction technology built on top of Solana’s high-performance blockchain. This project focuses on encrypted computation, privacy-preserving transfers, and zero-knowledge verification to ensure secure and confidential asset movement within the Solana ecosystem.

Features

Encrypted Transfers: Perform private token transfers where amounts and memos remain hidden on-chain.

Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Verify transaction validity (no inflation, correct balances) without revealing sensitive data.

Commitment-Based State: Uses Pedersen commitments and nullifiers to prevent double-spending while maintaining privacy.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: Fully functional across Windows, macOS, and Linux environments.

Modular Design: Easily integrates with existing Solana smart contracts or external privacy frameworks.

Getting Started
To begin using the Encrypted Solana Project, follow these steps below.

Prerequisites

Rust and Solana CLI installed

Node.js (for client-side SDK integration)

A wallet supporting encryption and view keys

This project delivers a secure, modern foundation for private digital asset transfers — combining Solana’s speed with next-generation cryptographic privacy.
